# OIM3640-Final-Project-Ziqi-Tina

## The Big Idea
### Project Overview:
This project is about utilizing APIs to design a program that can help the users get recommendations on what to eat for their daily meals based on their dietary goals, the recommendation will not only make sure users can reach their eventual diet goals scientifically, but also have sufficient nutrition for healthy human needs. 

### Main Purpose:
The program is a tool for users who intend to reach certain dietary goals or lose/gain weight. When we are on a diet, we often find ourselves struggling with deciding what to eat, for that we are not sure how many calories we have eaten. And sometimes when we eat less, we are not meeting the nutrition requirement. These can lead to failed diet and weight control, even unhealthy conditions, or is at least an annoying effort to come up with what to eat every day. To solve this daily pain, we want to create this program. 
The users will be asked to input their current weight, age, height, gender, exercise frequency level, as well as the intended weight control goal, the program will calculate the daily calorie limit that the user needs to maintain in order to reach that goal. Then, the program will generate random food recommendations with quantity (ingredients) in sections of carbs, fibers, proteins, etc. that not only meet the calorie requirement, but also meet the requirements for basic healthy diet composition. If the user is not happy with the recommendation, they can always regenerate a new recommendation with another randomization. 

### Minimum and Stretch Goal
A minimum viable product would be a food recommendation system that outputs randomized suggestions of food that meets the user's daily calorie requirement. A stretch on this project would be allowing recommendations to meet different dietary goals, for example, maintain weight or slight weight loss etc, as well as perform a better looking web app. A further stretch would be to allow users to input their allergies and dietary restrictions like vegan or gluten free, and then return the food accordingly.

## Learning Goals
We will be employing the skills of basic calculation, randomization, conditional clauses, dictionary, WebApp development, and etc., we are looking forward to improving ourselves on these skills. Besides these essential skills, we also want to practice our critical thinking and problem solving skills, as we know that when software design comes to real life practice, there will be a lot more issues that are not expected or unable to be foreseen. The ability to adapt to different situations and solve problems is very important for programming. When the bug or issue comes up, we should be able to locate it and solve them by applying our knowledge. In our perspective, this skill of problem solving is the most important key to coding and both of us would learn a lot in practicing. Individually speaking, Tina would like to improve her skills on how to restrict users’ inputs in a designated format, and Ziqi would like to improve her coding abilities on html coding on web aesthetics. 

## Implementation Plan
To enable our designed function, we will be utilizing two APIs, the first one is the [Fitness Calculator](https://rapidapi.com/malaaddincelik/api/fitness-calculator), and the second is the [NutritionNix](https://www.nutritionix.com/). The first API will allow us to input user body information and return with BMI, daily calories requirement on different weight control goals, etc. The demo is as below.

The second API is a database of food. It contains the nutrition facts of 790,041 grocery goods. By searching the food, it will return facts like calories, amount of carbohydrates, dietary fibers, fat etc. We are still finalizing our search for effective nutrition APIs and we might use another one if we find it better.
We will ask the users to input their age, gender, weight, height, exercise level, and weight control goal, then by using the Fitness Calculator API, we will check the weight control goal in the returned calories requirements. With this returned daily calories requirement, we will then randomize a choice of food in each category of carbs, fibers, proteins, and etc. The sum of calories of these categories will add up to the daily calories requirement. In this way, we will make sure the user meets weight control goals, and also has a balanced diet with all categories. 
With consideration of allergies and dietary restrictions, we will allow users to always regenerate a new set of recommendations to meet their preference. Of course, if we have time, we can try to include restrictions in the code and let users input restrictions.

## Project Schedule
To develop this project, we plan to first come up with a general agenda and timeline about the project. Splitting the whole process into major two sections — first the back-end development and then the front-end web development. In the back-end development, we have two major functions that we need to develop. The first one is to fetch the according daily calories requirement with the help of API and users’ inputs. After this, we will design the function of randomization recommendations. We are anticipating the second part to take a longer time as the categorization of food in such a huge database might bring issues. 
After developing the back-end, we will work on the front-end web app development. In this part, we will first work on enabling the app on the website by having all the user input labels and returning pages ready. After the basic function is met, we will then work on the aesthetic and UI of the website. We are planning on completing the back-end development before Thanksgiving, and work on the front-end after we come back.

## Collaboration Plan
In this project, we will both work on the back-end and front-end development together, but in a micro-perspective, we will assign each small specific task to each person. For specific tasks that require coding, we will complete the code independently, and then combine the works with one another after discussion. And for errors and issues that occurred, we will first look through codes from our class and search online for explanation tutorials. If the issue still remains unresolved, we will consult with professor Li for advice. For each task, we will test the codes together to make sure the program runs smoothly with no errors neglected. As for software development methodology, we will adopt agile development. Since we are a small group, we are able to guarantee real-time communication which is key to maintain frequent incremental improvements in this methodology. Through iterations that contain small increments on the codes that control the program functionality and web aesthetics, the efficiency will be improved since the team will be able to locate and fix the errors in a timely manner.

## Risks
A risk that we might encounter during the project is the risk of API call limit, since we are only using a free API plan with restricted calls, it might return error if we have too many calls. What’s more, the API database of food is very large, and we will have the risk of returning foods that meet the nutrition goal, but are actually not healthy foods due to ways of cooking etc. Unforeseeable risks are always the largest difficulty of a project, just like in Assignment 3, we will encounter errors from time to time, and only when it really occurs, can we start to think about it and try to solve it. These unforeseeable errors may stall our progress as we cannot plan ahead to solve them. But it is also the unforeseeable issues that really trains our ability in problem solving.

## Additional Course Content
I think content on how to add in interesting functionalities that can improve the users’ experience and convenience on our website. We wish to establish a website where each function (button) is presented logically and conveniently. And to further improve our users’ experiences, we would also like to learn more interesting codes that can help with web aesthetics.
