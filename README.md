This program aims to provide users with randomized healthy daily meal plan recommendations that satisfy their dietary goals. These recommendations will not only make sure users can reach their eventual diet goals scientifically, but also the users can have sufficient nutrition for healthy human needs. 

## <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexnaiman/alexnaiman/master/resources/Confused_Dog.gif" height="50px" /> Program Overview
The program is presented in a website, users can simply inputing their age, gender, height, weight, activity level, and weight goal. As a result, the users can conveniently return a recommended list of food that covers  all 7 categories: fruits, vegetables, dairy eggs, drinks, fish, grains pluses, meat (all in a 100 grams or 100 milliliters unit). Since the  recommendation is generated randomly, if the users are not satisfied with the recommended items in the list, all they need to do is to just refresh the web page and a new list will be generated. 

We utilize API to get the information about the matched calories based on user provided age, gender, height, weight, and activity level. And we also use the data provided by MYPROTEIN's Food Calories Chart to create a set of csv files that contain the calories information (Kcal per 100g) about each food item across all 7 categories.
